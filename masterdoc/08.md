### Exercise 1: Create a Fabric workspace

In this exercise, you build a lakehouse, ingest sample data into the delta table, apply transformation where required, and then create reports.

#### Task 1.1: Assign Fabric Administrator Role

1. Start by searching for **Microsoft Entra ID** in the search pane in the Azure portal:

#### Task 1.3: Create a workspace

Here, you create a Fabric workspace. The workspace contains all the items needed for this lakehouse tutorial, which includes lakehouse, dataflows, Data Factory pipelines, notebooks, Power BI datasets, and reports.

1.  Now, select **Workspaces** and click on **+ New workspace**:

    ![New Workspace](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/MIDP-Lab-With-Microsoft-Fabric/blob/dev/media/08/11.png?raw=true)

2. Fill out the **Create a workspace** form with the following details:

   - **Name:** Enter **Fabric Lakehouse Tutorial**, and any extra characters to make the name unique.

   - **Description:** Enter **Lakehouse Demo**

   ![name-and-desc-of-workspc](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/MIDP-Lab-With-Microsoft-Fabric/blob/dev/media/08/12.png?raw=true)

   - **Advanced:** Expand it and Under **License mode**, select **Trial capacity (1)**.

3. Select **Apply (2)** to create and open the workspace.
