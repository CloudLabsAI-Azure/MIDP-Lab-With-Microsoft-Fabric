# Exercise 1: Create a Fabric workspace

##### **Estimated Duration: 30 minutes**

## Overview

In this exercise, you will set up a Microsoft Fabric environment by assigning yourself the Fabric Administrator role, activating a 60-day free trial, and creating a workspace to organize project components. You will also build a lakehouse, ingest sample data into a delta table, apply necessary transformations, and create reports. This will provide a hands-on foundation for effectively managing and utilizing Microsoft Fabric for data operations.

## Lab objectives

- Task 1: Assign Fabric Administrator Role
- Task 2: Sign up for the Microsoft Fabric Trial
- Task 3: Create a workspace
