## Task 3: Create a workspace

Here, you will create a Fabric workspace. The workspace contains all the items needed for this lakehouse tutorial, which includes lakehouse, dataflows, Data Factory pipelines, notebooks, Power BI datasets, and reports.

1. Now, select **Workspaces** and click on **+ New workspace**.

   ![New Workspace](../media/08/11.png) 

2. Fill out the **Create a workspace** form with the following details:

   - **Name:** Enter **Fabric Lakehouse Tutorial** **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**, and any extra characters to make the name unique.
   - **Description:** Enter **Lakehouse Demo**

   ![name-and-desc-of-workspc](../media/08/12.png) 

3. Select Advanced, expand it, and Under **License mode**, select **Trial capacity (1)** and click on **Apply (2)** to create and open the workspace.

   ![advanced-and-apply](../media/08/13.png)

4. A new workspace titled **Fabric Lakehouse Tutorial** **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** will be created. This workspace will serve as a designated area where you can organize and manage your project components, data, and reports, providing a centralized hub for all related activities and resources.
