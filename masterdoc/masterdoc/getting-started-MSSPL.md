# Get data into Fabric Lakehouse

## Overall Estimated Duration: 3 Hours

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will work through a comprehensive data processing and analytics flow. You'll begin by setting up the data source, which consists of Parquet files stored in an unpartitioned structure, with each table organized into its own folder. You will create a pipeline to ingest this historical or one-time data into a Lakehouse. Next, you'll create a Lakehouse, ingest the data into its files section, and then establish Delta Lake tables in the Tables section for structured storage. 

## Objectives

Understand how to set up a Fabric workspace, build a lakehouse, ingest and transform data, and create reports. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Create a Fabric workspace**: Gain experience on creating and setting up a Fabric workspace, including understanding prerequisites and executing the workspace creation process.
- **Build a lakehouse**: Gain experience in building a lakehouse by activating SharePoint Online, creating the lakehouse, ingesting sample data, and building a report.
- **Ingest data into the lakehouse**: Learn to ingest data into the lakehouse, focusing on efficient and effective data integration methods. 

## Pre-requisites

To effectively perform these exercises, you need basic knowledge of Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Fabric, SharePoint Online, and data management principles. You also need to be familiar with creating and managing lakehouses, data ingestion, transformation, and reporting in Microsoft Fabric or Power BI.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, you will work through the architecture flow illustrated in the diagram, focusing on data ingestion, transformation, storage, and consumption. You’ll start by connecting to various data sources, both structured and unstructured, and utilizing shortcuts or data pipelines to ingest this data into a Lakehouse. Once the data is ingested, you’ll transform it using notebooks and dataflows, ensuring it is optimized for analysis. The transformed data will be stored in the Lakehouse, a hybrid storage solution that supports both raw and structured data. Finally, you will connect to this data using tools like Power BI or SQL endpoints, enabling real-time reporting and visualization. Throughout the lab, you'll gain hands-on experience in managing and analyzing data end-to-end within this integrated architecture.

The platform provides a full range of services, such as Data Engineering, Data Factory, Data Science, Real-Time Analytics, Data Warehousing, and Databases.

- **Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse**: Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse is a comprehensive data architecture platform designed for storing, managing, and analyzing both structured and unstructured data in a unified environment. It offers flexibility and scalability, enabling organizations to handle extensive data volumes with a range of tools and frameworks for processing and analysis. By integrating with various data management and analytics tools, it provides a holistic solution for data engineering and analytics.

- **SharePoint Online**: SharePoint Online is a cloud-based service from Microsoft that facilitates collaboration, document management, and content sharing within organizations. It enables users to create, store, and manage web-based documents and data, offering tools for team sites, document libraries, and lists.

- **Fabric Lakehouse**: Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse is a data architecture platform designed to store, manage, and analyze both structured and unstructured data in one unified location. It offers flexibility and scalability, enabling organizations to handle extensive data volumes through a range of tools and frameworks for processing and analysis. The platform integrates seamlessly with other data management and analytics tools, delivering a comprehensive solution for data engineering and analytics.

- **Power BI**: Power BI is a suite of software services, applications, and connectors that collaborate to transform disparate data sources into cohesive, visually engaging, and interactive insights. Whether your data comes from an Excel spreadsheet or a mix of cloud-based and on-premises data warehouses, Power BI enables you to seamlessly connect to these sources, uncover and visualize key information, and share insights with anyone you choose.

- **SQL**: SQL(Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to perform operations such as querying data, inserting, updating, and deleting records, as well as defining and altering database structures. SQL is essential for efficiently handling and analyzing structured data within relational databases.
