### Exercise 1: Data ingestion from a spectrum of analytical and operational data sources into the Lakehouse. <a name="data-ingestion"></a>

As a data engineer at Wide World Importers, you will start by landing data from a variety of sources into the Lakehouse. This data will be further cleansed, processed, and confirmed by using Azure Databricks and Delta Live Tables. This is a preparation step for the downstream consumption of the data by data scientists and business intelligence analysts. Data sources include data related to its customers, products, marketing campaigns, social media, and sales transactions. This data is often generated in raw file formats such as CSV, JSON, unstructured files, and even images. A lot of the existing data is historical as well.

To boost customer satisfaction, gain a competitive advantage, and ultimately drive revenue growth, Wide World Importers wants to analyze its data to obtain meaningful insights related to their customers, marketing campaigns, and sales forecasts. However, their immediate challenge is to generate and use near real-time streaming data. So, they installed IoT devices in their stores to analyze customer shopping patterns and thermostat readings. They also set up Azure Data Explorer (ADX) with anomaly detection to correlate in-store traffic and store temperatures. As a result, they now have a large volume of real-time streaming data related to in-store traffic, temperature readings and anomaly detection.

In this exercise, you will explore how to ingest near real-time data into the Lakehouse and derive meaningful insights from them.


#### Task 1.1: Explore a Streaming data and analytics pipeline using ADX for a near real-time analytics scenario. <a name="streaming-data"></a>

Wide World Importers wants its customers to have a pleasant in-store shopping experience. Maintaining the optimal temperature in stores and wine coolers is one way to accomplish this objective.

Consider that the Black Friday Sale in-store event has just started at 6:00 AM EST, and customers are arriving in large numbers at the Miami store. As described earlier, thermostat data from the stores is streamed in real-time to an Azure Event Hub and then into an Azure Data Explorer (ADX) pool for analysis.

In this task, you will use ADX to explore thermostat data from the stores streamed in near real-time to an Azure Event Hub.

41. Select **Run**. 

42. In the **Results** pane (located along the bottom), review the query result expressed as a chart. Please note that it may take up to 2-3 minutes to accumulate data. If you do not see any result please re-run the query after some time. 

    >**Note:** If you don't see data in the query result, wait for a few minutes and try again since the data will take a few minutes to start streaming. In case your query returns an error, chances are that the thermostat table was not created successfully in previous steps. You may have to create that table with a different name e.g. Thermostat1, update the KQL query accordingly and re-execute the KQL query.  

    ![Review the query result ](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Ignite-lab/blob/main/media/img_graph1.png?raw=true)

    *Your graph may appear slightly different than the one shown above. It may take up to 60 seconds to load.*

43. Notice that the temperature in the Miami store is oscillating between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on these insights, we are able to adjust the temperatures to optimal levels.
